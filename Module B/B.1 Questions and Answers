Explain the difference between byte, short, int, and long.
  Byte - a group of binary digits such as ones and zeroes
  Short - a data type  that is 16 bit signed two's integer complement
  Int - a data type that is 32 bit signed two's integer complement
  Long - a data type that is 64 bit signed two's integer complement

Which type would you use most often for a whole number?
