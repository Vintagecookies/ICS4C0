Explain the difference between byte, short, int, and long.
  Byte - a group of binary digits such as ones and zeroes. It is 8 bit.
  Short - a data type  that is 16 bit signed two's integer complement
  Int - a data type that is 32 bit signed two's integer complement
  Long - a data type that is 64 bit signed two's integer complement
  
Which type would you use most often for a whole number?
  You would use a int to stored a whole number.

When would you use the type long?

When would you use the type char and when would you use the object String?
  You would use char when you are storing data in a fixed-length field. You would use the object string when creating a sequence of Unicode characters
